      <description>Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive!!.
-Sir Walter Scott
Previously on codedinsugar.com Now that we have our secretProject Kubernetes cluster built, let&amp;rsquo;s throw some custom apps in there!
Keep it simple and sweet This is NOT a Kubernetes (k8s) tutorial! The k8s ecosystem is massive if you&amp;rsquo;re into container orchestration, read their docs here. I use k8s everyday at work and at home and even though it&amp;rsquo;s almost become second nature for me, I still don&amp;rsquo;t know everything about it&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Mr. Wizard! Get me the hell out of here!.

Previously on codedinsugar.com Continuing where we left off, we&amp;rsquo;ve used libvirt/virt-install to successfully create three vm&amp;rsquo;s for our Kubernetes cluster for secretProject. So what happens next?
Let&amp;rsquo;s play with Ansible I&amp;rsquo;ve used Ansible often in the past but it was never a core part of my daily work. There is a lot to learn about Ansible and I highly suggest you check out their site, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the SRE/DevOps space.</description>

Previously on codedinsugar.com Continuing where we left off, I wanted to build a kvm vm&amp;rsquo;s to run a Kubernetes cluster for the secretProject platform.
Since the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s I&amp;rsquo;ve used several virtualization hypervisors, including:
Hyper-V KVM VMware VirtualBox XenServer Not including AWS EC2 and Docker But for the purpose of secretProject and the need to self-host on a single bare metal machine, I needed the most lightweight solution and luckily without the need a ton of features.</description>

Where to start? Ask a thousand software enthusiasts what the two most difficult things about software development is and you&amp;rsquo;ll likely aggregate to:
Deciding what to develop Naming what you want to develop What to develop? About 5 years ago I came up with the idea for a personal project (hereinafter called secretProject), an application that would mainly serve two purposes:</description>

-Buzz Lightyear
I spend a lot of time at the terminal, either in vscode or a zsh shell.
Two apps I use often are tldr and cht.sh because:
