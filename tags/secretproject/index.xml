Previously on codedinsugar.com Continuing where we left off, we&amp;rsquo;ve used libvirt/virt-install to successfully create three vm&amp;rsquo;s for our Kubernetes cluster for secretProject. So what happens next?
Let&amp;rsquo;s play with Ansible I&amp;rsquo;ve used Ansible often in the past but it was never a core part of my daily work. There is a lot to learn about Ansible and I highly suggest you check out their site, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the SRE/DevOps space.</description>

Since the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s I&amp;rsquo;ve used several virtualization hypervisors, including:
